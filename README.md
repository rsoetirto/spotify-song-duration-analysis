# spotify-song-duration-analysis

Research has shown that the average duration of mainstream songs has decreased over the years. In 2020, the average duration was 197 seconds or 3.2 minutes.

Why are mainstreams songs getting shorter? Is there possibly an economic incentive to create songs that are universally shorter in duration?

Online streaming platforms, like Spotify, generate their revenue from the amount of streams that a song accumulates indicating that there might be a positive relationship between duration and streams, and thus revenue.

Using a dataset acquired from Kaggle, this study aims to study that hypothesis.
